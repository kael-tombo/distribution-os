# Distribution OS — Testing Guide

> How we test Distribution OS. Covers test structure, running tests,
> writing new tests, common patterns, and coverage goals.
>
> Current runner (2026-09-07): `npm test` builds the application, then
> `scripts/test.mjs` discovers both `.test.ts` and `.test.mjs` files and runs
> them through `tsx` and Node's test runner. TypeScript tests are not emitted
> by the application build. Run `npm run typecheck` separately; the Vite build
> does not replace it. Inventory and coverage tables below are historical,
> not measured coverage or a complete current test count.

Campaign brief regression coverage lives in `tests/campaign-brief.test.ts`.
Run `node --import tsx --test tests/campaign-brief.test.ts` for its nine cases.
They apply all migrations to a fresh in-memory SQLite database and exercise
production queries, audit rollback, revision conflicts, tenant isolation,
history retention, deletion, validation and handoff exports. This verifies
the SQL contract through a D1-compatible batch fixture; it is not a hosted
D1 or browser interaction test.

Campaign planning adds `campaign-planning.test.ts` and
`campaign-planner.test.ts` (23 cases) plus a rendered planning-card case in
`rendered-html.test.mjs`. They cover objective validation, exact confirmation,
claim races, tenant isolation, audit rollback, expired leases, retry/rolling
limits, cancellation and the mocked AI contract. The September 13 review adds
maximum-length accepted input coverage, complete brief exports, and starting
a new objective from an unchanged brief after cancellation while preserving
the earlier job. Rendered recovery states point to the new-revision control.

For a complete HTTP check, build the Docker image and start a disposable
instance **without volumes, environment files or provider credentials**:

```sh
docker compose build
docker run --rm -d --name distribution-os-planning-check -p 127.0.0.1:5174:5173 -e DISTRIBUTION_LOCAL_WORKSPACE=1 distribution-os-app:latest
node scripts/smoke-campaign-planning.mjs http://localhost:5174
docker stop distribution-os-planning-check
```

The smoke script creates synthetic data and refuses a nonempty brief/planning
workspace. It is intentionally restricted to the disposable port, not the
main local app. It checks authentication, save/confirm/run/reload, duplicate
confirmation, stale execution, unavailable AI and validation errors against
the actual D1 development runtime. The disposable container is removed on
stop; no live provider is called.

Distribution OS is built around a strict separation between **pure
business logic** (in `lib/*-pure.ts` and `db/*-pure.ts`) and **runtime
adapters** (route handlers, the Worker entry point, the D1 access
layer). The test suite leans into this separation: every pure module
has a sibling `tests/*.test.ts` that exercises it in isolation, with
no D1 binding, no network, no wall clock.

## Test runner

We use the Node.js built-in test runner (`node:test`) with
`node:assert/strict`. No Jest, no Mocha, no Vitest — the built-in runner
is fast, has zero install cost, and integrates cleanly with
`node --test`.

| Concern             | Choice                                                |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Runner              | `node:test` (built into Node ≥22.13)                  |
| Assertions          | `node:assert/strict`                                  |
| File extension      | `.test.ts` (pure-logic) / `.test.mjs` (rendered HTML) |
| Build prerequisite  | `npm run build` (TypeScript → JS)                     |
| Test discovery      | `scripts/test.mjs`: both `.test.ts` and `.test.mjs` |

The runner discovers test files in `tests/` and invokes Node's test runner
through `tsx`, which loads TypeScript source directly. The application build
does not emit test files. A `.test.mjs`-only glob omits TypeScript tests and
must not be used as the complete suite.

Each test file mirrors its source module's name. Pure-logic tests are
`.test.ts`; integration / build-dependent tests are `.test.mjs`.

---

## Running tests

### Full suite (build + test)

```bash
npm run test
```

This runs `npm run build && node --test tests/*.test.mjs`. The build is
required because the `.ts` tests are transpiled to `.mjs` during the
build.

### Tests only (skipping the build)

If you've already built (e.g. via `npm run dev` or a previous
`npm run build`), you can skip the build:

```bash
node --test tests/*.test.mjs
```

### Filter by name

```bash
node --test --test-name-pattern="state machine" tests/*.test.mjs
```

### Filter by file

```bash
node --test tests/url-safety.test.mjs
```

### Watch mode

Node's built-in test runner does not yet have a watch mode. Use
`nodemon` or rerun manually:

```bash
nodemon --exec "node --test tests/url-safety.test.mjs" -- tests/ lib/url-safety.ts
```

### Verbose output

```bash
node --test --test-reporter=spec tests/*.test.mjs
```

### TAP output (for CI)

```bash
node --test --test-reporter=tap tests/*.test.mjs > test-results.tap
```

---

## Writing a new test

### 1. Identify the source module

Every pure module is in `lib/*-pure.ts` or `db/*-pure.ts`. If the
function you're testing has any I/O (D1, fetch, `Date.now()`,
`Math.random()`), it should either:

- Be moved into the pure module with an injectable dependency (e.g.
  `nowMs: number` parameter), OR
- Live in the runtime adapter (`db/*.ts` or `app/api/**/route.ts`) and
  be tested via an integration test.

### 2. Create the test file

The test file should be named `tests/<module-name>.test.ts` (drop the
`-pure` suffix for clarity). For example, `lib/foo-pure.ts` →
`tests/foo.test.ts`.

### 3. Use the standard scaffold

```ts
import assert from "node:assert/strict";
import test from "node:test";

import { /* exports under test */ } from "../lib/foo-pure";

test("foo() returns the expected value for typical input", () => {
  const result = foo("input");
  assert.equal(result, "expected");
});

test("foo() throws on invalid input", () => {
  assert.throws(() => foo(""), /non-empty/);
});

test("foo() is deterministic across calls", () => {
  const a = foo("input");
  const b = foo("input");
  assert.equal(a, b);
});
```

### 4. Run the new test

```bash
node --test tests/foo.test.mjs    # after a build
# OR
npm run test                       # full build + test
```

### 5. Assert the new file is picked up

The `npm run test` glob is `tests/*.test.mjs`, so any `.test.ts` file
in `tests/` will be transpiled and discovered automatically.

---

## Common patterns

### Pattern 1 — Pure function with explicit `now`

Pure modules that need time take `nowMs` as an explicit parameter so the
test is deterministic without mocking the wall clock:

```ts
// lib/idempotency-pure.ts
export function isRecordValid(record: IdempotencyRecord, nowMs: number): boolean {
  return nowMs < record.expiresAtMs;
}

// tests/idempotency.test.ts
test("isRecordValid returns false at expiry boundary", () => {
  const record = { expiresAtMs: 1000 } as IdempotencyRecord;
  assert.equal(isRecordValid(record, 999), true);
  assert.equal(isRecordValid(record, 1000), false);
  assert.equal(isRecordValid(record, 1001), false);
});
```

### Pattern 2 — Injectable fetch for SSRF tests

`fetchWithRedirectLimit` accepts a `fetchImpl` override so tests can
simulate redirect chains, timeouts, and oversized bodies without
network:

```ts
test("rejects when Location points at a private IP", async () => {
  const fakeFetch = async (url: string) =>
    new Response(null, {
      status: 302,
      headers: { location: "http://169.254.169.254/" },
    });
  await assert.rejects(
    () => fetchWithRedirectLimit("https://example.com", { fetchImpl: fakeFetch }),
    /Private\/reserved/,
  );
});
```

### Pattern 3 — State-machine transition table

Every state machine exposes `canTransition(from, to)` and
`isTerminal(status)`. Tests iterate every permitted and forbidden
transition:

```ts
test("every permitted transition returns true", () => {
  for (const [from, targets] of Object.entries(ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS)) {
    for (const to of targets) {
      assert.equal(canTransition(from as ActionStatus, to as ActionStatus), true);
    }
  }
});

test("terminal statuses have no outgoing transitions", () => {
  for (const status of ACTION_STATUSES) {
    assert.equal(
      isTerminal(status),
      ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS[status].length === 0,
    );
  }
});
```

### Pattern 4 — Constant-time comparison

For HMAC verification, tests assert that length-mismatched inputs
return `false` immediately and that the comparison is constant-time
(no early-exit on first-byte mismatch):

```ts
test("timingSafeEqual returns false for different-length inputs", () => {
  assert.equal(timingSafeEqual("abc", "abcd"), false);
});

test("timingSafeEqual returns true for equal inputs", () => {
  assert.equal(timingSafeEqual("abc", "abc"), true);
});
```

### Pattern 5 — Redaction assertions

For `summarizeForDisplay` projections, assert that every sensitive field
is gone and every safe field is preserved:

```ts
test("summarizeForDisplay redacts token_reference and workspace_id", () => {
  const summary = summarizeForDisplay(row);
  assert.equal("token_reference" in summary, false);
  assert.equal("workspace_id" in summary, false);
  assert.equal(summary.provider, row.provider);
  assert.equal(summary.status, row.status);
});
```

### Pattern 6 — Build-dependent `.test.mjs`

For tests that need the built output (e.g. rendered HTML, shadcn
component smoke tests), use `.test.mjs` and import from the build
output:

```js
// tests/rendered-html.test.mjs
import assert from "node:assert/strict";
import test from "node:test";
import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";

test("landing page contains the hero CTA", () => {
  const html = readFileSync("./dist/index.html", "utf-8");
  assert.match(html, /Launch a mission/);
});
```

## Coverage goals

| Surface                          | Goal          | Current                                       |
| -------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Pure modules (`lib/*-pure.ts`)   | 100% line     | 33 test files covering all 21 lib modules     |
| Pure modules (`db/*-pure.ts`)    | 100% line     | 12 test files covering all 12 db pure modules |
| State-machine transition tables  | 100% branches | Every (from, to) pair asserted                |
| Sanitisation / redaction helpers | 100% line     | Every `summarizeForDisplay` asserted          |
| Route handlers                   | Smoke         | Manual + 1 build-dependent HTML test          |
| D1 access layer (`db/*.ts`)      | Manual        | Not unit-tested (requires D1 binding)         |

We do not currently enforce a coverage percentage in CI. The
expectation is that **every new pure function** ships with a sibling
test, and **every new state machine** ships with a transition-table
test.

### How to check coverage manually

```bash
node --test --experimental-test-coverage tests/*.test.mjs
```

This prints per-file line coverage. Investigate any file below 90%.

## CI integration

The `npm run test` script is the single entry point for CI. A typical
GitHub Actions step:

```yaml
- name: Install
  run: npm run install:ci

- name: Lint
  run: npm run lint

- name: Test
  run: npm run test
```

### Parallelisation

`node --test` runs files in parallel by default (one process per CPU
core). No special configuration needed.

### Test artifacts

For TAP-compatible CI dashboards:

```bash
node --test --test-reporter=tap tests/*.test.mjs > test-results.tap
```

### Failure exit code

`node --test` exits non-zero if any test fails. CI should treat any
non-zero exit as a build break.

### Build dependency

`npm test` runs the application build first, so a bundling failure prevents
the tests from running. The build does not perform TypeScript type checking.
Use `npm run verify` to run type checking, lint, the build and the full suite.
